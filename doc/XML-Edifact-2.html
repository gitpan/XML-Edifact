<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Release Notes:</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 About the beauty of plain text</A></H2>

<P>Standards should be based on standards. EDIFACT is based on ASCII and
documentation is available from WWW.Premenos.Com as plain text.
Well the original contains some PCDOS characters. I took the freedom, to
replace them with ASCII in this distribution to improve readability.
I don't talk about human readability here. A friend at SAP joked that
plain paper is the only platform independent format in that case. But
I disliked to retype them. And plain text is more flexible, as I'm a
programmer.</P>
<P>Unlike the 0.1 distribution, following distributions will only contain
those documents I need to parse by the scripts. Download the 0.1
for a complete set, or surf at Premenos.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Its a hard work to cook a second version.</A></H2>

<P>As usual. Second versions claim to be better documented and tested, but
the truth - they contain more features. So talk about features:</P>
<P>First of all: Its looking like a module. "use strict" and the package
concept is a usefull thing. But it'll take a lot of RTFM for me to
understand the perl way of doing it. The XML/Edifact.pm doesnt export
anything, and its not even neccessary to "perl Makefile.PL; make install".</P>
<P>A 0.2 version is not intendet to become installed, its a test case.</P>
<P>So talk about the test case: Run ./bin/make_test.sh from here, and
anything should be fine. Still it need some RTFM for me to understand
the perl way of regession test. But the ./bin/make_test.sh is the
one this version offers ,-)</P>
<P>I'm now using a tied hash for speeding startup. I've deceided to use SDBM
as this DBM comes with any perl, and a small DBM is better in this case.</P>
<P>I've provided a document type definition. And its now possible to use
a validating parser like SP from James Clark. You may also notice the
renaming from Edi2SGML to XML::Edifact. This namechange reflects that
my script is now producing XML and not SGML, and the name should point
where in cpan hirachy this package belongs.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 About normalisation and namespaces</A></H2>

<P>You may notice the major change in the DBM design. While the old
DBM files had been modeled closely to the batch directory. This
version has been partly normalised to improve coding. Its also
denormalised for some perlish reasons. To unload this DBM into
a relational database would be possible with varchars, but the
meaning of the 2nd element in segments and composite could only
be expressed with some wired object relational ones like Postgres.</P>
<P>Also the DTD changed for namespace reason. The 0.2 need to add
the word literal, where element names clashed segment names of
the standard. And it droped the composite informations.
Now trsd:party.name means the segment, while tred:party.name points
to the element.  This allows to parse the XML message to produce
a EDI message without an backtracking parser.</P>
<P>A last note about change of 0.2 to 0.30. Treat this number as
0.3.0 translated to perl canon. The 0.3 is not finished, coming
versions claiming to be any 0.3? will be step stones to what I
think the 30% XML::Edifact solution should contain. This 0.3.0
does nothing more than the 0.2, but with namespaces and a new
DBM design.</P>
