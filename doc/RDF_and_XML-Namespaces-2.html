<H2><A NAME="s2">2. RDF to describe XML::EDIFACT namespaces</A></H2>

<P>XML::Edifact has several default namespaces. Those are called
edifact, trsd, trcd, tred, uncl, anxs, anxc, anxe, unsl and unknown.
The edifact namespace is intended to cover the overall message,
while the four character namespaces are extracted from their
UN/EDIFACT batch directory counterparts.</P>
<P>But XML document type definitions are badly suited to constrain
Edifact messages. While any valid UN/EDIFACT message will
produce a valid XML::Edifact message, it would be possible
to hack a valid XML::Edifact message, where the conforming
UN/EDIFACT is not even well formed!</P>
<P>Once a UN/EDIFACT message is parsed, translated to XML and
stored in a DOM, it may have elements in the unknown namespace,
most likely to come from unknown codes. As those elements from
the unknown namespace are not defined in the edifact document
type definition, a validating parser would trigger further
checks. The parser now has to query a resource description
framework to find a resolution for the unknown namespace. The
Document now has migrated in namespace.  Now it's not an
edifact:message, but perhaps an editeur or etis:message or
even a kraehe:message, if we agree on private extensions.
Even if a resolution cant be found the document would migrate
in namespace becoming an unknown:message as unknown:message's
can have unknown elements.</P>
<P>Further checks using the RDF are now necessary. The current
document has a generic type and is just a sequential collection
of translated UN/EDIFACT segments. The parser may check those
segments using the RDF files provided for each namespace, when
designing new messages. Most important are checks in the top
level RDF the document type will migrate from the generic
edifact:message to edifact:invoic or edifact:orders, the
structure of segment groups will be patched into the DOM
on that time.</P>
<P>A last check using trading partner and document type as index
on a RDF will round up for trade partner constrains. Now the
message can be further processed.</P>
