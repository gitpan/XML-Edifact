<P>I'm using even and odd numbering to distinct from stable and
experimental version. Well 0.2 was not as stable as an
even number suggests. And I hope this 0.3x is stable enough
as as often a third version, will be the first usefull one.
<P>Both 0.4x track and 0.5x track are active currently. The 0.35
was quite stable, and there is a need for portability, while the
version under development is far from beeing usable.
<DL>
<DT><B>0.4x</B><DD><P>This version focus on portability, of the EdiCooked style.
<P>While Perl ensures
portability across the unix'es, MacOS and Win32 will cause
some problems. The 0.4 version will also be the first one
intended to become installed. As installation also means
configuration of non Perlish paths e.g. for webserver,
mime.types, mailcap, dtds and databases, XML::Config.pm
will be discussed in the perlxml list.
<DT><B>0.5x</B><DD><P>This is the unstable version track.
<P>XML::Edifact now provides
PerlSAX objects as drivers and handlers to UN/EDIFACT, making
usage more flexible. Current step is the reverse engineering
of a document type definition for the original EDI standard draft.
<DT><B>0.6x</B><DD><P>Stabilisation by disscussion and consens about features
introduced with 0.5. Portability across networks using SAX
may be one concern.
<DT><B>0.7x</B><DD><P>EdiCooked is far from being KISS. This release will try on a
smarter DTD called EdiLean. EdiLean will focus on PRICAT, QUOTES,
ORDERS, ORDRSP, ORDCHG and INVOICE. If a consens about a KISS
XML/EDI already exist, EdiLean will try to implement it.
<DT><B>0.8x</B><DD><P>Stabilisation by disscussion and consens about the XML DTDs
introduced with 0.7.
<DT><B>0.9x</B><DD><P>Its important for me that authentication and authorisation
will be provided <CODE>before</CODE> I call it final 1.0. Some
Edifact messages contain medical informations (MED*), other
contain personal informations (JOB*). Most messages contain
viable information for running a bussiness. Only cryptography
on a document level would preserve authentication and authorisation
once a message stored on a disk.

proposed a simple solution using namespaces and processing
instructions at the perlxml mailing list in December 1998. The beauty
of this aproach is, that the secure document is still wellformed and
valid of the same document type. It could even translated back to
UN/EDIFACT to obtain a message with crypted segments.
<DT><B>1.0</B><DD><P>I hope that any consens have been found on that road, so the DTDs
wont change in further releases. Those versions may focus on
<CODE>using</CODE> XML::Edifact in real life applications. I can think
about an SQL interface, a Cobol interface, a message designer,
a DOM/CORBA wrapper, and much more.
<P>Once I think to have XML::Edifact complete, I have to think about
speed. Perl is a perfect language for prototyping, but profiling
and using a low level language like C for hot spots, will be
necessary to handle large batches.
