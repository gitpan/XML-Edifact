<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Known Bugs</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Double namespace declarations</A></H2>

<P>Namespace declaration was redefined in January 1999. XML::Edifact 0.30
produced <CODE>both</CODE> the old and the new declarations. XML::Edifact 0.31
droped the depreciated declartions! If you have an old browser, you may
have to download XML::Edifact 0.30 and to edit the actual XML::Edifact.
Search for <CODE>HERE_</CODE> and adopt the headers to your browsers preferences.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Stating level in Syntax identifier.</A></H2>

<P>This has to be parsed. The stating level in EDIFACT speak is
called charset encoding in XML speak, and its of course important
if you thing about non US/UK products. See un_edifact/unsl.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Explicit Indication of Nesting</A></H2>

<P>This has not been coded yet, as no example messsages are available
to me.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 XML::Edifact is slow!</A></H2>

<P>The example real life message teleord.edi still needs about 36
seconds on a Sun3/60 running NetBSD. Even as newer computers
are faster, XML::Edifact would <CODE>not</CODE> be able to handle the
daily batches of large UN/EDIFACT routers like TeleOdering UK.
The solution of this problem will become delayed till version 1.2,
when parts of the module will be recoded in C.</P>
