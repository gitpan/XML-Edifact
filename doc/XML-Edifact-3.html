<P>I've included my modified documents, so others can be able to rebuild
the DBM files. You may need a Unix like system because of newline
conventions. This current 0.3x version is not intended to become
"installed", just run everything from this path.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        $ ./bin/make_data.sh
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This will take a while (48 seconds on my Sun 3/60 :-) and you
hopefully have a working database. Any <CODE>foo.ext changed</CODE>
messages are a bad thing, and is probately based on a failure
with packing/unpacking of this distribution.</P>
<P>You can now test XML::Edifact it with:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        $ perl bin/edi2xml.pl examples/nad_buyer.edi
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>You can try other example files, and if you have own EDI files
try them: I really want to know how your EDI messages look like,
if they break anything, what about your code list extension, ...</P>
<P>Testing different real examples should show some bugs, I hav'nt
thought about.  Think about the <CODE>O'Reilly</CODE> invoice or the
<CODE>Dubbel:Test</CODE> and you should catch the clue. I've tried to implement
the <CODE>UNA</CODE> right, but this may need some additional debugging.
Take a look at the difference between the edi.tst files from Frankfurt
and the Springer message. The last one is using newline as a 9th
character in UNA, so its nearly human readable.</P>
<P>To run a complete test, type</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        $ perl bin/make_spool.sh
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>This will transform my EDI examples into XML and place them together
with a DTD in the ./spool directory. You already have those files,
they are compared with their counterparts in the ./example directory.
If you dont see any <CODE>foo.bar changed</CODE> message, anything went fine.</P>
<P>Lets talk about the perl way of installation and regression test in
the 0.4 version.</P>
