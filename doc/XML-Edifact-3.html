<P>I've included my modified documents, so others can be able to rebuild
the DBM files. You may need a Unix like system because of newline
conventions.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        $ perl Makefile.PL

        I know I should check for those 99 possible places, but I prefer to ask :-)

        URL for public documents [http://localhost/xml-edifact] 
        Directory on this system [/usr/local/apache/htdocs/xml-edifact] 

        Writing Makefile for XML::Edifact

        $ make
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CODE>perl perl Makefile.PL</CODE> will first ask two questions. The reason
is that XML::Edifact wants to install his document type definition
on a web server to allow validation XML parser to grep the DTD.
<P>If you dont have a web server, anwer "." as the URL and
"/tmp/xml-edifact" as a directoryname. You may change those
decissions later by reperling the Makefile.PL, or by editing
the XML::Edifact::Config module in your SITE_PERL.
<P>Make will take a while and you hopefully have a working database.
This database covers the 96b version of the UN/EDIFACT batch
directory and will become installed as XML::Edifact::d96b later.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        $ make test
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The regression test will translate any .edi file found in the
examples directory to xml and translate the xml back to EDIFACT.
The result should not change.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        $ make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This will install the XML::Edifact module the D96B batch directory,
various files for the URL and two scripts: <CODE>edi2xml</CODE> and <CODE>xml2edi</CODE>
<P>You can now try own UN/EDIFACT files. I really want to know how your
EDI messages look like, do they break anything, what about your code
list extension, ...
<P>Testing different real examples should show some bugs, I hav'nt
thought about.  Think about the <CODE>O'Reilly</CODE> invoice or the
<CODE>Dubbel:Test</CODE> and you should catch the clue. I've tried to implement
the <CODE>UNA</CODE> right, but this may need some additional debugging.
Take a look at the difference between the editeur.edi file from
Frankfurt and the Springer message. The last one is using newline
as a 9th character in UNA, so its nearly human readable.
<P>A last word - I hope this complex installlation will work on most
Unix look likes, but I'm quite sure that it'll break on Windows and
Mac. If you have such a system, and problems during installation,
drop me a mail. You are granted my help, as I need your help to
make the installation portabel across different platforms.
